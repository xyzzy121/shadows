 trait_shadow:0 "Shadow"
 trait_shadow_desc:0 "The Shadows are ageless but they are not immortal nor are they virtually indestructible. They reproduce sexually and new members are hatched just as the first Shadows did eons ago. The Shadows have mastered the ability to phase directly into hyperspace, with the result that they exist in "phase space", a sub-dimension that is similar to that of hyperspace. They are able to move in and out of that sub-dimension at will, and when a Shadow is out of phase with realspace it is undetectable, immaterial, and intangible, which gives them the ability to walk through solid objects - they can be immaterial or solid whenever they desire."
 trait_shadow_physiology:0 "Shadow Physiology"
 trait_shadow_physiology_desc:0 "Shadows are insectoid creatures on six multi-jointed legs, with an upper body that possesses two hooked claws and a head covered by a crown of chitinous spikes and horns. On their face are numerous glowing yellow-red eyes. The fractal-edged claws are able to rip through steel as if it were nothing more than paper. Due to the minute protrusions and probes on the claws' edges, they can easily and precisely manipulate micro-sized objects. By lacing the Shadow carapaces with synergic configurations of carbon and dense metals, they have made them virtually unbreakable. Shadows have evolved beyond the need for specific organs, therefore they are mostly a spongy mass that functions as muscle, digestive system, lungs, and energy storage at once. They augment their bodies with numerous technological implants. Shadows possess massive brains, which are a coiled mass of black tissue whose activity is thousands of times greater than that of younger races. The entire electromagnetic spectrum is visible to their multifaceted eyes, and each pair of eyes possesses its own special perceptive capabilities."
